# A-Computational-Study-of-Random-Projection-in-the-Brain
This repo hosts the code and materials for a Bachelor's thesis on computational representations in neural research, inspired by the work of Papadimitriou and Vempala. It aims to validate theoretical constructs of neural computation through a computational model exploring neural assemblies, random projections, and synaptic plasticity.
