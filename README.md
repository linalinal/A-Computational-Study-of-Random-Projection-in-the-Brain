# A-Computational-Study-of-Random-Projection-in-the-Brain
This repository contains the source code and related materials for a Bachelor's thesis focusing on exploring the computational representations in neural research. The project is inspired by the theoretical constructs of neural computation by Christos H. Papadimitriou and Santosh S. Vempala, aiming to bridge theory with empirical validation through computational modeling.

Main Focus:
Neural Assemblies and Random Projections: The project delves into the intricate dynamics of neural assemblies and the role of random projections in neural computation, exploring their stochastic pathways and the inherent randomness that enhances the brainâ€™s computational capabilities.

Computational Modeling: 
The codebase includes a computational model reflecting the mathematical nuances and concepts such as sparse coding, connectivity rules, and synaptic plasticity, allowing for detailed behavioral simulations to validate and refine theoretical postulations.

Empirical Validation: 
The project aims to align theoretical predictions with results derived from computational models, shedding light on potential divergences and providing insights into real biological behavior and brain functionalities.

Features:
Configurable Brain Structure: The model allows for the configuration of different brain areas, each symbolizing a unique brain region, and encompassing a configurable number of neurons.

Connectivity Rules: 
The model simulates intricate connectivity patterns within and between different brain areas, with configurable probabilities, allowing for the emergence of network dynamics and interactions.

Plasticity and Synaptic Weight Fading: 
The model incorporates synaptic plasticity updates and a synaptic weight fading mechanism to simulate homeostasis and maintain stability in the neural network.

Relevance:
This work is pivotal for understanding the applications and implications of random projections in neural computation and offers a comprehensive overview of deterministic and randomized approaches in brain functions, contributing to the ongoing discourse in neuroscience and computational biology.
